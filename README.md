# 🏠 Real Estate Pre-Arrears AI Solution

[![AI Governance](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI%20Governance-Dynamic%20Guardrails-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides an **end-to-end AI solution** for real estate brokerages in Texas to **identify and engage homeowners at risk of property tax arrears** *before* county delinquent lists are published.  

The system blends:
- County data ingestion
- Risk scoring
- Broker-friendly dashboards
- Compliant outreach (letters, calls, CRM sync)
- Continuous feedback loops

---

## ⚡ TL;DR — Texas Property Tax Arrears
- **Bills issued:** October  
- **Delinquent:** February 1  
- **Penalties:** 6% first month + 1% monthly until July; 12% penalty in July + monthly interest  
- **Final step:** County tax sales, often heavily competitive  

> ✅ Early outreach positions brokers **ahead of investor-heavy public sale lists**.

---

## 🔎 Probing Questions (Kickoff Checklist)
1. Which **counties** first? (Dallas, Tarrant, Harris?)  
2. How do you access **county data** (CSV, PDF, HTML)?  
3. **Update cadence** (daily during tax season, weekly otherwise)?  
4. **Property scope:** homestead only, or include commercial?  
5. **Exclusions:** probate, age/disability exemptions?  
6. **Outreach rules:** postal, calls (TCPA/DNC scrubbing), bilingual letters?  
7. **Compliance guardrails:** TREC advertising, fair housing, disclosures?  
8. What **CRM** should integrate (kvCORE, HubSpot, etc.)?

🪜 Step-by-Step Action Plan

Phase 1 — Discovery & Compliance (Week 1–2)
	•	Select 2 pilot counties (Dallas + Tarrant).
	•	Confirm legal guardrails with broker and counsel.
	•	Define metrics: 10 appointments/month → 3 signed listings/month.

Phase 2 — Data & Scoring (Week 3–5)
	•	Connect county data (CSV/PDF/HTML).
	•	Normalize APNs and owner data.
	•	Score by: near delinquency, exemptions, history, value trends.

Phase 3 — App & Outreach (Week 6–8)
	•	MVP dashboard: map + list + owner card + letter generator.
	•	CRM sync + DNC scrub.
	•	Train agents on talk-track + letter.

Phase 4 — Pilot & Iterate (Week 9–10)
	•	Two 2-week sprints.
	•	Measure connect rate, appointment rate, listing rate.

Phase 5 — Scale (Week 11–12)
	•	Add Harris + smaller counties.
	•	Weekly refresh outside tax season.
	•	Weekly “insight emails” → top properties, zips, wins.

👉 Do you want me to also generate a **`/docs/diagrams/` folder with separate `.md` files** for each Mermaid workflow (so they can render independently on GitHub Pages), or should everything stay inside a single README.md?
