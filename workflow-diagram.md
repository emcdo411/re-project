AI Adoption Workflow Analysis
This README presents a workflow diagram illustrating the current state of AI adoption in businesses, associated risks, and proposed solutions by Level-Field.ai. The diagram is designed to provide a clear, visual representation of how current AI usage trends lead to specific risks and how those risks can be mitigated with targeted solutions.
Workflow Diagram
Below is a flowchart created using Mermaid to visualize the relationship between the current state of AI adoption, business risks, and Level-Field.ai's solutions.

Diagram Overview
The flowchart is divided into three columns:

Current State: Highlights key findings from a GA survey, including AI usage (68%), AI agent adoption (51%), and low training levels (17%).
Business Risks: Identifies risks stemming from current trends, such as compliance gaps (e.g., TCPA, GDPR, Fair Housing), unstructured adoption, and missed ROI due to low conversion and wasted spend.
Level-Field.ai Solutions: Proposes solutions to address these risks, including AI guardrails with training and policies, execution roadmaps for structured adoption, and traction dashboards for investor-ready KPIs.

Legend: The diagram includes a legend to clarify the color coding for Current State, Risks, and Solutions.
Viewing the Diagram
To render the diagram:

Copy the Mermaid code above into a Mermaid-compatible viewer like Mermaid Live Editor.
Alternatively, view this README in a GitHub repository or a Markdown renderer that supports Mermaid (e.g., GitHub, VS Code with Mermaid plugins).

The diagram uses a clean grayscale theme for accessibility, with subtle shading to differentiate nodes and clear arrows to show the flow from current state to risks and solutions.
